# Arbitrage_opportunities
This project showcases the Crypto Arbitrage opportunities that were happening in early 2018, but within months decreased to nearly nothing. 

Zooming in on past events we can see how volitile markets can sometimes be ripe with arbitrage opportunities. When data collection & buy/sell is automated to watched carefully across multiple exchanges, and act quickly, there are profits to be made!

*This project can be used to calculate the daily profit to be made when arbitrage is highand one acts quickly, vs waiting until many others take advantage of the opportunity first causing the arbitrage spread to narrow near 0.*

## Technologies

This Project is built to run in Jupyter Lab:

 Python 3.7 for coding
 
 Pandas for data analysis
 
 pathlib for importing and reading csv data files.

## Data Collection and Cleaning

1. **The data for this analysis was pulled using the pathlib library from 2 CSV files containing closing prices on bitstamp and coinbase spanning from 01-01-2018 to 03-31-2018.** 

    - It was converted to a dataframe using Pandas indexed to the date-time. 

![code image csv_read]("./images/image_csv_read.png")

2. **The data was then cleaned and standardized via the following steps (example code of one data frame only)**

    - removing null values
    
    `bitstamp = bitstamp.dropna()`
    
    - removing dollar signs in the "Close" column
    
    `bitstamp['Close'] = bitstamp['Close'].str.replace("$", " ")`
    
    - standardized all data types in the "Close" column to float
    
    `bitstamp['Close'] = bitstamp['Close'].astype(float)`
    
    - checked for duplicated values
    
    `bitstamp.duplicated().sum()`

## Data Analysis

For Analysis, the data used for analysis was the closing price of the stocks; identified in the "Close" heading.
The data was sliced to narrow down the values and time-frame of interest. 

1. **First, we took a look at the closing data for the enitre time-frame in our data sets.**

`bitstamp_sliced = bitstamp[['Close']].loc['2018-01-01':'2018-03-31']`

    - General statistics were generated
    
`bitstamp[["Close"]].describe()`
    
    - The closing price values of the two dataframes over the entire time-frame were plotted for visualization
    
![overlay plot]("./images/overlay_plot.png)

2. **We then focused our analysis on the arbitrage spread between the two exchange values, over 3 different, 1-day periods in the datase**

    - 1-day early in the dataset (early), 1-day midway through the dataset (middle), and 1-day toward the end of the dataset(late).
    
`arbitrage_spread_early = coinbase['Close'].loc['2018-01-10'] - bitstamp['Close'].loc['2018-01-10']`
    
`arbitrage_spread_middle = bitstamp['Close'].loc['2018-02-16'] - coinbase['Close'].loc['2018-02-16']`
    
`arbitrage_spread_late = bitstamp['Close'].loc['2018-03-22'] - coinbase['Close'].loc['2018-03-22']`
    
    - Giving focused data for plotting and seeing a visualization of the spread difference.
    
![box_plot]("./images/box_plot_early.png) 
![box_middle]("./images/box_plot_middle.png)
![box_late]("./images/box_plot_late.png)
    
3. ** Final Step was determining the profits to be made during each time period identified above.

    - The arbitrage spread was used for each of the the 3 days selected to find the arbitrage return. Returns were filterd for those with a value over 1%, which accounted for the buy/sell fees. 
    
    `spread_return_early = arbitrage_spread_early[arbitrage_spread_early>0] / bitstamp['Close'].loc['2018-01-10']`
    
    - Profit was determined by multiplying the filtered returns by the cost of the trade value, giving us the profit per trade value.
    
    `profit_early = spread_return_early[spread_return_early > .01] * bitstamp['Close'].loc['2018-01-10']`
    
![describe of profits]("./images/profit_early.png)

![profit per trade early plot]("./images/profit_per_trade")

    - the cumulative sum function `cum_sum` was used and results plotted for each time period to see how profits accumulated over time
    
`cumulative_profit_early = profit_per_trade_early.cumsum()`

![cum_sum plot]("./images/cum_sum_plot")
